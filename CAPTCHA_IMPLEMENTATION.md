# Captcha Implementation for Registration Form

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a simple captcha system to protect the registration form from automated bot registrations. The implementation includes both backend API endpoints and frontend React components.

## Implementation Details

### Backend (API)

#### Dependencies Added
- `svg-captcha`: A simple library for generating SVG-based captcha images

#### New Endpoint: `GET /auth/captcha`
- **Purpose**: Generates a new captcha challenge
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "captchaId": "unique-session-id",
    "captchaSvg": "<svg>...</svg>"
  }
  ```
- **Features**:
  - 5-character alphanumeric captcha
  - Colorful SVG with background
  - 2 noise lines for additional security
  - 5-minute expiration time
  - In-memory session storage (can be upgraded to Redis for production)

#### Updated Endpoint: `POST /auth/register`
- **New Required Fields**:
  - `captchaId`: The session ID from the captcha generation
  - `captchaValue`: User's answer to the captcha challenge
- **Validation**:
  - Checks if captcha ID exists and hasn't expired
  - Validates user input against stored captcha text (case-insensitive)
  - Removes used captcha session to prevent reuse

### Frontend (UI)

#### Dependencies Added
- `react-simple-captcha`: For handling captcha display and interaction

#### New Component: `Captcha.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Displays SVG captcha image
  - Input field for user response
  - Refresh button to get new captcha
  - Error state handling
  - Responsive design matching the existing form style

#### Updated Component: `Register.tsx`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Integrated captcha component into registration form
  - Added captcha validation to form validation logic
  - Updated registration API call to include captcha data
  - Error handling for captcha-related failures

## Security Features

1. **Session-based**: Each captcha has a unique session ID
2. **Time-limited**: Captchas expire after 5 minutes
3. **Single-use**: Used captchas are immediately removed
4. **Case-insensitive**: User-friendly input validation
5. **Memory cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions every 5 minutes

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to the registration page
2. Fill in the required fields (name, email, password)
3. View the captcha image and enter the characters shown
4. Click the refresh button if the captcha is unclear
5. Submit the form

### For Developers
The captcha system is automatically integrated into the registration flow. No additional configuration is required beyond the standard environment setup.

## Testing

The captcha implementation can be tested by:
1. Starting the API server: `npm run dev` (in packages/api)
2. Starting the UI: `npm run dev` (in packages/ui)
3. Navigating to `/register` in the browser
4. Testing both successful and failed captcha submissions

## Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:
1. **Redis Storage**: Replace in-memory session storage with Redis for scalability
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add additional rate limiting for captcha generation
3. **Monitoring**: Log captcha generation and validation metrics
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure captcha is accessible to users with disabilities
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Test captcha visibility on mobile devices

## API Documentation

The captcha endpoints are fully documented in the Swagger API documentation available at `/api-docs` when the server is running.

## Example Flow

1. **Frontend** calls `GET /auth/captcha`
2. **Backend** generates captcha and returns `{captchaId, captchaSvg}`
3. **Frontend** displays SVG and collects user input
4. **Frontend** submits registration with `{name, email, password, captchaId, captchaValue}`
5. **Backend** validates captcha and proceeds with user registration

This implementation provides a good balance between security and user experience, effectively preventing automated bot registrations while remaining user-friendly.
